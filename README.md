# MyLinkVault 🔐

A simple, self-hosted web application to save, organize, and quickly access all your frequently used links and "watch later" items.

## 💡 The Problem

I found myself scattering links, bookmarks, and videos I wanted to watch later across different apps, text files, and browser tabs. It was disorganized, inefficient, and I could never find what I needed when I needed it.

## ✨ The Solution

**MyLinkVault** is my personal solution to this problem. It's a central, self-hosted website where I can:

* **Store Frequent Links:** Keep all my commonly used links (work tools, favorite sites, documentation) in one place.
* **Build a "Watch Later" Queue:** Save articles, videos, and other media to consume later without cluttering my bookmarks.
* **Access Anywhere:** Since it's a website, I can access my links from any device with a browser.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Add New Links:** A simple form to add a new URL, a descriptive title, and notes.
* **Categorization:** Easily distinguish between "Frequent Links" and "Watch Later" items.
* **Search/Filter:** (Add this if you've built it) Quickly find the link you're looking for.
* **One-Click Access:** Open saved links directly from the dashboard.
* **Edit & Delete:** Easily manage your saved links.

## 💻 Tech Stack

This project was built using:

* **Frontend:** [e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or a framework like React/Vue]
* **Backend:** [e.g., PHP/Laravel, Node.js/Express, Python/Django]
* **Database:** [e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite]

*(You mentioned creating this "through loveable" - if that's a typo for **Laravel**, you'd put `PHP/Laravel` in the backend section!)*

## 🛠️ Setup & Installation

This project is primarily for my personal use. To set it up locally or on a new server:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[your-username]/mylinkvault.git
    cd mylinkvault
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    *(Add your dependency installation command here)*
    ```bash
    # Example for Node.js
    npm install
    
    # Example for PHP/Composer (Laravel)
    composer install
    ```

3.  **Environment Configuration:**
    * Copy the example environment file: `cp .env.example .env`
    * Edit the `.env` file to set up your database credentials (`DB_HOST`, `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD`, etc.) and application key.

4.  **Database Migration:**
    *(Add your database migration command here)*
    ```bash
    # Example for Laravel
    php artisan migrate
    ```

5.  **Run the Application:**
    *(Add your command to start the server)*
    ```bash
    # Example for Node.js
    npm start
    
    # Example for Laravel
    php artisan serve
    ```

6.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:[your-port]` (e.g., `http://localhost:3000` or `http://localhost:8000`).

## 🔮 Future Ideas

While the main problem is solved, here are some features I might add in the future:

* [ ] Add browser extensions (Chrome/Firefox) to save links in one click.
* [ ] Auto-fetch website titles and favicons when a link is added.
* [ ] Add tagging support for better organization.
* [ ] Create user authentication (if I ever want to share it).
